## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/29Ir96R.png)

It is a software that I am developing in order to be able to make data flow in a healthy way in the communication of companies with each other.

Why should we use this?

* Completely open source.
* It cares about your privacy.
* Possibility of use without license.
* If you like to work regularly, it's just for you.

## Built With

This software will have the feature of being the most comprehensive software developed by me. And I would like to say to you with regret that it will take time for the full version to be released, since it was developed by a single person.

## Usage

It may take some time to use the full version. I will update this part a lot.

## Roadmap

We will add new ones to our knowledge and we will grow together with you.
